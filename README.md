# Penetration-Testing-Project

This file is my completed challenge project for the University of Toronto's Cybersecurity Bootcamp Module.

Students were required to conduct a simulated penetration test against the fictional company Rekall Corporation as part of this project. Students engaged with and tried to exploit a Windows desktop, a Linux server, a Windows Domain Controller, and a web application over the course of two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, students were told to write a report that would serve as a summary of the test results and be given to Rekall Corporation's corporate management.


I describe the vulnerabilities found during the penetration test in my report, along with suggested repair methods for MegaCorpOne in light of the successfully identified vulnerabilities.
